# Example

## configuration

Please change the `config.json` according to your specific details.

## running it

First you need to (re)build the software, as the examples are not shipped with the modules `dist`.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

then you can run the example by using

```bash
$ node ./dist/examples/beepAndFlash/index.js
```
